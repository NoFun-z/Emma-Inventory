# Emma-Inventory

C#, HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap and SQL program

This project allows users to navigate to different pages to maintain the systemâ€™s datasets using RAD/ADO approach
The user can filter related data in the inventory, customer details and their orders
All the relevant data is shown when the search buttons are clicked, the user then can use CRUD operations to maintain the data
The design is simplified and everything can be modified with html and css
All the objects and navigations are user-friendly and easy to follow
I used these approaches since SQL database is a very common language which many company uses to maintain their data. With RAD/ADO approach we can consistently build the data within C#
